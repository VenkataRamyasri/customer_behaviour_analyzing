Here, this project is a customer behavior analysis project, which is the analysis of data. Here  it's the combination of Python, SQL, along with Power BI. Here Python is used to clean the data and SQL, which is used to extract the data  from the table. So the data is stored in the form of table and for that accessing of data, we use SQL and Power BI, which is used to analyze the data in the visualization format.
